Custom IoT PCB with ESP32-C3-02 and TP4056 Li-ion Charger

Designed a multi-layer PCB integrating ESP32-C3-02 SoC with Wi-Fi/BLE connectivity and TP4056-based Li-ion charging circuitry.

Developed firmware in ESP-IDF (C/C++) for sensor data acquisition, real-time display, and SD card storage.

Implemented secure communication protocols over Wi-Fi/BLE for reliable IoT data transfer.

Built an IoT edge computing platform by integrating environmental sensors (BME280, light, sound) with onboard data processing and visualization.

Optimized power management and PCB layout for efficient, battery-powered operation with thermal regulation and safe charging.
